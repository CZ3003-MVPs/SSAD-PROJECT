# FirestoreTask

**Extends:** [Reference](../Reference)

## Description

# @meta-authors NicolÃ² 'fenix' Santilio,
# @meta-version 1.2
#
# A [code]FirestoreTask[/code] is an indipendent node inheriting [code]HTTPRequest[/code] that processes a [code]Firestore[/code] request.
# Once the Task is completed (both if successfully or not) it will emit the relative signal (or a general purpose signal [code]task_finished()[/code]) and will destroy automatically.
#
# Being a [code]Node[/code] it can be stored in a variable to yield on it, and receive its result as a callback.
# All signals emitted by a [code]FirestoreTask[/code] represent a direct level of signal communication, which can be high ([code]get_document(document), result_query(result)[/code]) or low ([code]task_finished(result)[/code]).
# An indirect level of communication with Tasks is also provided, redirecting signals to the [class FirebaseFirestore] module.
#
# ex.
# [code]var task : FirestoreTask = Firebase.Firestore.query(query)[/code]
# [code]var result : Array = yield(task, "task_finished")[/code]
# [code]var result : Array = yield(task, "result_query")[/code]
# [code]var result : Array = yield(Firebase.Firestore, "task_finished")[/code]
# [code]var result : Array = yield(Firebase.Firestore, "result_query")[/code]
